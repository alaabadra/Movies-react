# React Movie App

## Problem:
* ### A person is a busy person and wants to watch movies but when he searches for Films for watching he doesn't find it or the film isn't good.

## Our great goal :
* ### The web page is used to make the user able to search for any movie and see a description of the movie and also able to add the movie to watchlist and also able to download the movie.

## Solution
* ### We build a wep app that will allow the user to search throw movies, filter his results, download whatever movie he wants and add any movie to his watchlist.
